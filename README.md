## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains a curated set of **four Jupyter notebooks** developed for a quantum computing workshop held at **CESUPA (Faculdade CESUPA)**. The goal is to introduce students to quantum programming, linear algebra of quantum states, and quantum teleportation using *Qiskit*. All examples are designed to be clear, modular, and instructive.

This workshop was conducted at CESUPA (Faculdade CESUPA) by [Carlos Esteves](https://github.com/10CarlosEsteves) and [Lucca Nobre](https://github.com/Lucca0404)  in may 2025 for undergraduate students interested in quantum computing. The series is intended as a didactic introduction, balancing theoretical foundations with hands-on simulation.

## üìÇ Notebook Contents & Structure

Below is an organized summary of each notebook and its educational purpose:

| Notebook | Title | Focus / Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| **Code 001 ‚Äì Statevectors and Operators** | Statevectors and Operators | Introduces matrix algebra, statevectors, and how quantum gates act on states. |
| **Code 002 ‚Äì Noise Free Simulation** | Noise Free Simulation | Builds and simulates quantum circuits using noise-free backends (e.g. Qiskit‚Äôs Aer simulator). |
| **Code 003 ‚Äì Noisy Simulation** | Noisy Simulation | Introduces noise models, simulates errors, and observes their impact on results. |
| **Code 004 ‚Äì Quantum Teleportation** | Quantum Teleportation | Step-by-step implementation of the quantum teleportation protocol (ideal/noiseless version). |

These are arranged in increasing complexity, culminating in the teleportation example.
